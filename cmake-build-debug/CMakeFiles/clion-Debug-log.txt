CMake Error at src/main_files/CMakeLists.txt:3 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findglad.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "glad", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "glad" with any of
  the following names:

    gladConfig.cmake
    glad-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "glad" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "glad_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "glad"
  provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
  installed.
